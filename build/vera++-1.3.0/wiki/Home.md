Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Vera++ homepage. This is the new official home for
Vera++.

I would like to thank Maciej Sobczak who had written the original
Vera++ program and had supported it for so long. Thank you for your
contributions and thank you for letting the community an opportunity
to take Vera++ even further.

Description
-----------

Vera++ is a programmable tool for verification, analysis and transformation of C++ source code. Vera++ is mainly an engine that parses C++ source files and presents the result of this parsing to scripts in the form of various collections - the scripts are actually performing the requested tasks.
