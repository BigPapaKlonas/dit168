\centerline{\textbf{\LARGE Sprint 5 Retrospective 27.04.2018 - 04.05.2018}}

\section*{What did we learn?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Technical and technological aspect
		\begin{enumerate} 
			\item Vera ++
			\item Every car is different and unique in their own way, for example Group 07 does not turn as sharp as us
		\end{enumerate} 
	\item Process issues
		\begin{enumerate} 
			\item After the presentation on W17, we took a break to celebrate being done with following and celebrating the May 1st holiday, this caused a short sprint, so not much got done
			\item Inter team collaboration when testing platooning, Group 07 couldnâ€™t show up at good/comfortable times for us, which caused staying in school for long hours
		\end{enumerate}		
	\item Documentation related matters
		\begin{enumerate} 
			\item Planning the report and work division
			\item Everyone's learning LaTeX basics for the report
		\end{enumerate}	
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{What worked well during this sprint?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scrum master made a big improvement from the past sprints
	\item Communication amongst team members is good
	\item good work ethic = everyone does work
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{What went wrong/poorly this sprint?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Needed a more controlled dry run, with Group 07 to test the scenario, to avoid lots of reruns during demo
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{What can be improved during the next sprint?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item More standups
\end{enumerate} 


\section*{Was this sprint affected by unavailability of any members?}
Yes, all members were not as active due to the holiday, short sprint. The group we were helping test following could only show up in late afternoon, at which point some of our team members were not able to be present.
