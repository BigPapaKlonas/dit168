\section{Identified risks}
Several risks that may arise throughout development were identified. \par
\fi

% Risk list section
\section{Risk List}
Numerous risks that may interfere with the development's continuation are identified and evaluated, see table 1 below. For each risk, its impact, probability and magnitude are estimated and presented in the table. See the key below for details on these paradigms. 

% Key for table below in bullet points form
\begin{itemize}
\item I - (impact). Impact is a numerical value, usually between 1 and 5, that represents the impact to the project if the risk comes true. 5 is a HIGH IMPACT and 1 is LOW IMPACT.
\item P - (probability). Probability is the percentage chance that a risk will occur.
\item M - (magnitude). Magnitude is the result of the multiplication of Probability and Impact, providing a joint metric suitable for sorting.
\end{itemize}

Obtain as much knowledge as possible about these tools before the development phase.

Always have a 'soft deadline' an appropriate time before the actual deadline. In case this soft deadline is not met, additional emergency meetings prior to the hard deadline will take place in order to make sure that the actual deadline is met and necessary resources are assigned. \\ \hline

Use pair programming to improve developer efficiency and project velocity. Assign multiple developers for key tasks, in case one becomes unavailable. Have an open dialogue within the team to know one another's status. \\ \hline

The risk is an extreme case of Disagreement Amongst Stakeholders. The risk is surrounding developers fighting and animosity towards each other getting in the way of progress.&

Confront TAs immediately with the problem to make sure it is taken cared of as soon as possible. If the car gets unavailable over a longer time, prioritize development of features that do not, somehow, require direct access to the car. Last resort, borrow another group's car. \\ \hline

\section{Heat Map}
To visualize the possible project risks a heat map was made, for the purpose of improved visualization. The individual risks are represented via blue dots, the size varying based on their magnitude. The most severe risks are located at the top-right corner, whereas the least at the bottom-left corner. \par
Risks R3 \& R7 have the same Impact and Likilihood, therefore they have identical position on the graph. To compensate for this, the label for R3 has been positioned above the risk dot. Moreover, most of the risk are located to concentrated i

\section{Risk Evaluation}
The purpose of this section is to go through the risks in Table \ref{Risk Table}, and to evaluate their mitigation stategies. \par 
Risk R1 was encountered during the project, but it is not believed to have as a significant impact as initially believed. The mitigation stategy for the risk seemed to work fine as the project group manage to attain knowledge about Docker and CMake before work with the cars begain. Additionally, the development team would utilize the offered Q\&A session to get access to the TAs for help and guidance. \par
R6 apperared as the miniature vehicle unable to turn right. The mitigation stategies for this issue did not work as the "right turn" issue persisted until the conclusion of the project. Moreover, it was not possible to borrow a new car. However, the mitigation stategies did work on other hardware issues that were less severe.  \par
The last major risk encountered is identified as R8. Although, the mitigation stategy outlined was not of the most concrete it did provide value. During W17 the development team worked closely with another group. The solution to having following be as close as possible was to impose a controlled environment. Meaning the development teams used the same network to test and present, the distance between starting car were measured and the alligned of the cars at the start were controller. Moreover, the development team encorporated a number of command line parameters to attempt to make the code as dynamic as possible for the purpose of fine tuning the V2V following. \par
Risks R2 and R5, relating to team communication did not occur, as there were no major conflicts during the project. Furthermore, R7 did not occur as the development team found 2 teams to test the V2V-Protocol and V2V following.  \par
R3 and R4 were not present in the project, since all hard deadlines were met. Moreover, the brunt of the project started on Study Period 2, meaning the development team was not hindered by other courses or exams as initially thought. \par
The identified V2V-Protocol risks, R9 and R10 were not present either. Although, there were minor protocol issues that were addressed and fixed, due to the project team being allowed to tailor the protocol to an extent.
