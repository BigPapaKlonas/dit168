## Changes
#### Code within this directory are initially based on Adam2092's branch DIT168Example, which can be found here: https://github.com/Adam2092/DIT168Example.

Example.cpp, now terminal_controller.cpp, has been significantly changed. What remains intact, are how messages are received (within the initializing of the od4 session) and how to check if an od4 session is running. Futhermore, the messages.odvd is changed to include the message identifier for DistanceReading. Lastly, the name of the folder and the code are changed from example/Example to terminal_controller as well as the README files has been deleted.
